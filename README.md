# Mana AI — AI Chat Bot

Mana AI is a conversational AI chatbot web application inspired by ChatGPT. The project focuses on delivering a clean and responsive chat interface with an intelligent conversational flow.

⚡ **This project was built using a no-code / low-code approach, often referred to as _vibe coding_, without writing traditional code manually.**

---

## Overview

Mana AI is designed to simulate natural language conversations through a modern web interface. The main goal of this project is to explore AI-driven user interaction and rapid application creation using vibe coding techniques.

The application demonstrates how functional and interactive AI-based tools can be created efficiently without deep manual coding, while still maintaining a clean user experience.

How It Works
Mana AI uses a modern front-end setup to display conversational messages between the user and the AI interface. The logic and structure were generated using vibe coding techniques, enabling fast development without writing code line by line.

The project can later be extended with:

AI APIs (OpenAI or others)

Context memory

User authentication

Voice input/output

If you want, I can also:
- Add a **“Vibe Coding” explanation section**
- Rewrite it to sound **more experimental or more professional**
- Add **screenshots + demo badges**

Just say the word 😎
