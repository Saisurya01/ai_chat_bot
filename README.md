🧩 How It Works
Mana AI is a front-end application built with React. It provides a basic chat interface where users can type messages and view responses. The logic for generating AI responses can be plugged in via an API or backend service.

This approach allows you to:

Replace placeholders with real AI API calls

Add context memory

Expand UI features like voice input or card replies

✅ Next Steps
You can enhance this project by:

Integrating OpenAI or other language model APIs

Adding conversational context memory

Implementing user authentication

Supporting themes (dark/light mode)

Adding animation or typing indicators

### Notes
- I kept it simple and clear so GitHub displays it cleanly
- You can later add a **Live demo link** and **screenshots** of the chat interface
- If you plan to use an AI API (OpenAI or others), I can add that integration section too

Just tell me what you want next.
